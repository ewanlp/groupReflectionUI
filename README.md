# GroupReflectionUI: MicroFrontEnd

### Purpose:
* Connect individuals with a community that promotes and supports vulnerability
* Provide members the opportunity to stay anonymous both in their data and to other members

### Solution
The Group Reflection UI is a simple page that allows users to view the others in the group. A user may queue up to speak, comment/question/provide feedback on what others have said, all while remaining optionally anonymous.

### Mission
In our experience, connecting and staying part of a supportive community can be difficult when there are multiple factors pushing us away. We hope to provide folks with a simple way to connect with those in their (virtual) community so that they may reap the benefits of reflection..., while still being at a distance.
